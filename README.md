# Infrared_NUC
Infrared_NUC code ,Submitted to IEEE Sensors Journal

**Dataset** 

We used both real and simulated datasets The simulation dataset is generated by code. We will release all simulation codes and datasets after the paper is accepted. Theoretically, it can be applied to all images. Including optical  images, multispectral images, infrared images, and microwave images.
