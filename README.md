# Infrared_NUC
A non-uniform correction framework for infrared images    
Infrared_NUC code ,Submitted to IEEE Sensors Journal

**Dataset** 

We used both real and simulated datasets The simulation dataset is generated by code. We will release all simulation codes and datasets after the paper is accepted. Theoretically, it can be applied to all images. Including optical  images, multispectral images, infrared images, and microwave images.


**Evaluation Metrics**

We will release our evaluation code after the manuscript is accepted.
Additionally, you can find the metrics for image evaluation in this link, which will include the NUC metric.
